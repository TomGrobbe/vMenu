# vMenu

\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

# Download & Installation & Permissions
**Download**

Click [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) to go to the releases page and download it.


--------

## Installation
1. Download the latest version.
2. Unzip everything, and take all the files from that zip, and place it in `/resources/vMenu/` on your server.
***NOTE: YOU HAVE TO NAME THE FOLDER `vMenu` (CASE SENSITIVE), OTHERWISE THIS RESOURCE WILL NOT WORK!***
3. Go to your server.cfg file and **AT THE VERY TOP**, add this line:
```text
exec permissions.cfg
```
4. Now, place this line anywhere in your server.cfg file, as long as it's somewhere below the one from step 3.
```text
start vMenu
```
**IMPORTANT** If you want to disable Time/Weather sync, then add this line **ABOVE** `start vMenu`:
```
set vMenuDisableTimeAndWeatherSync "true"
```
_**So, it should look like this:**_
```
set vMenuDisableTimeAndWeatherSync "true"
start vMenu
```
5. Go to `resources/vMenu/config/` and copy the `permissions.cfg` file to the _same folder_ wherever your **server.cfg** file is stored! So, you'll end up with `server.cfg` and `permissions.cfg` IN THE SAME FOLDER.
6. This step is optional **IF** you want to be lazy and just start playing right away. However, if you want to be able to change the time, weather and kick people from the server, or even restrict some of the features for certain players/groups, then go into your `permissions.cfg` file (the one you copied to the same folder as the server.cfg is located), and start editing it by following the instructions in there, and looking at the [permissions list here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/wiki/permissions).
7. Optional: if you want to change the key binding for the menu, simply add this line to your server.cfg file (doesn't matter where you place this line) and replace the `244` with any valid control id from [this list](https://docs.fivem.net/game-references/controls/#controls). You can also change the control for the NoClip menu (second line below).

**DO NOT ADD `""` OR SIMILAR QUOTES AROUND THE CONTROL ID!**
```
# 244 = M
set vMenuToggleMenuKey 244
# 289 = F2
set vMenuNoClipKey 289
```
8. Save the server.cfg file if you haven't already, and restart the server. You're now done, enjoy!
9. (v1.0.7+) In `/resources/vMenu/config` go to the `addons.json` file and customize it to add your own addon vehicles, player models and weapons. Restart the server and your addon weapons will show up in the menu (if the player has permission for it). If you're using v1.0.7, then copy the file to `/resources/vMenu/`, if you're using v1.0.8 you can choose to copy it, or leave it where it is (`/resources/vMenu/config`).
