# vMenu
vMenu is server sided menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

# Download & Installation & Permissions

## Download

Click [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) to go to the releases page and download it.

--------

## Installation
Please follow the instructions over at the [vMenu docs](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/installation)

## Zap Hosting
If you're using Zap Hosting, you may find that moving the `permissions.cfg` file to the same folder as your `server.cfg` file may not work correctly (it could get reset every time you restart your server).

If this is the case, leave your `permissions.cfg` file here: `/resources/vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` and add the following to the very top of your server.cfg file: `exec resources/vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` (instead of `exec permissions.cfg`).

You can also use ZAP Hosting's one-click installer for vMenu. Get a ZAP-Hosting server with a 10% lifetime discount [HERE](https://zap-hosting.com/vespura) and make sure to use `Vespura-a-3715` at checkout.

## MenuAPI
Starting from vMenu v2.1.0, vMenu will be using [MenuAPI (MAPI)](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI), a custom menu API designed specifically for vMenu by me.

vMenu v2.0.0 and earlier was [using a modified version of NativeUI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/NativeUI), originally by [Guad](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI), but converted to FiveM by the CitizenFX Collectives and myself (updated/refactored).
