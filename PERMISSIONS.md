## Features & Permissions List
**Almost all features have custom permissions options. Some options without permissions are not listed below, however they are present in the menu itself.**
>### âš  Please note that ALL permissions are `CaSeSeNSItIve`!

## Global Permissions
**Notes:**
1. __\*__ The `Default (allowed/denied)` values are based on the assumption that you use the default permissions file included with the menu, and you've granted yourself no special permissions or added yourself to any of the admin/moderator groups. If you **DON'T** use the default permissions file, then every option will be **DENIED** by default.
2. __\*\*__ These options are only allowed by default for the "Moderators" / "Admins" groups in the provided permissions file with this resource.
3. __\*\*\*__ When spawning a car using the `Spawn By Name` button, it will always check to see if you have permission for that specific vehicle's class. eg: If you don't have permission to spawn cars from the `Super` class, trying to spawn an `adder` using the `Spawn By Name` button won't work.

## About Submenu
The **About vMenu** submenu is always available for everyone, and can not be disabled with the use of permissions. If you don't feel like showing credits to everyone --which seems very selfish to me-- then you'll have to edit the code and disable it yourself, which also means I won't be giving you any support whatsoever.
